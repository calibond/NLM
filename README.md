# NLM
This project implements a Neural Language Model to predict and generate text sequences based on a training dataset. 
The model utilizes deep learning techniques to learn word representations and context, allowing for meaningful text generation and prediction.

Features
Preprocessing: Tokenization and sequence preparation for training.
Model Implementation: A neural network designed for language modeling.
Training: Optimizing the model using backpropagation and gradient descent.
Evaluation: Assessing model performance using perplexity and other metrics.
Text Generation: Producing coherent sequences based on learned representations.

Installation
To run this notebook, you need Python and the following dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas torch tensorflow keras nltk

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook Neural_Language_Model.ipynb
Run each cell sequentially to preprocess data, build the model, and train it on text data.
Evaluate the model and generate text sequences based on trained embeddings.

Results
The trained Neural Language Model can be used for:
- Predicting the next word in a sequence
- Generating text based on context
- Improving NLP applications such as chatbots and text summarization
